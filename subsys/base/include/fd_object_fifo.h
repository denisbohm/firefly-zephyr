// An object fifo contains a number of objects all of the same preconfigured size.
// To put an object into the fifo first allocate the object, then write the object content, then commit the object.
// To get an object from the fifo first view the object, read the object content, then deallocate the object.
//
// It is safe to put objects (allocate & commit) from one ISR/thread and get objects (view & deallocate) from one different ISR/thread.
//
// The intention of this class is to:
// a) Be safe for passing objects from one thread to another.
// b) Minimize buffers by allocating the object and filling its content before committing.
// c) Support robust communications by allowing objects to be viewed for sending and later deallocated on acknowledgement of reception.
